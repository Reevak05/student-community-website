    <br>
    The Student Community Model
</h3>
<br>
The Student Community Model is a project created during the COVID-19 pandemic to help alleviate isolation
which arose amongst students as a result of distance learning. It continues to be very useful in both hybrid and
fully in-person learning styles, even as the pandemic subsides. The Student Community Model was first created after a
problem with
distance learning was observed: casual connections had been completely and abruptly broken. You could no longer ask your
classmate about the homework assignment or even make a casual joke as you were walking out of math class. When online
class was over, the experience was suddenly and abruptly over. One moment you were in a classroom with your peers, and
the next moment you were in your room alone.
<br><br>
The project uses Discord as a platform to help students communicate. While Discord servers can be very simple, the
Student Community Model has very quickly grown in resources, complexity and features. The project includes a host of
original documentation, multiple Discord servers, a custom-developed bot, websites, large administration and moderation
teams, and more.
<br><br>
But how does the experience for students work? Each implementation of the Student Community Model
corresponds to one school. When students first join the server for their school, they are presented with a list of
classes and prompted to select the ones they are enrolled in. Based on their selections, they are given access to text
channels (places where people can chat with each other). Each server includes channels for nearly all of the most
popular classes, and even includes channels for grade levels, clubs, and other extracurricular groups. Each channel has
unique permission settings which allow the students who are in specific classes to view and chat in the channels.
<br><br>
The model has a clear and visible set of rules, an automated report system for rule-violations, a robust and largely
automated disciplinary system, and thorough and capable administration and moderation teams. You can be sure any Student
Community server is a safe and respectful place to be. The servers include bots,
which are automated tools made by various developers which execute
commands upon request, for a myriad of useful tasks. The math bot can act as a calculator, the chemistry bot can provide
atomic mass values for an element, the translation bot can tell you what “pickup truck” is in Spanish, and a great deal
more. The project also has plenty of other features, including an automated suggestions box that gives users the ability
to vote on suggestions.

    Athenian Community: the inaugural pilot for the model
</h3>
<br>
Athenian Community is the first deployment of the Student Community Model and functioned as a pilot program to create
the model. Athenian Community operates for students of The Athenian School. It gained 100+ members, from all four high
school grades, in just the first 7 months after launch and serves as a demonstration of the capability and usefulness of
the Student Community Model.
<br><br>

    <br>
    Why you should use the Student Community Model
</h3>
<br>
We're excited to expand the Student Community Model to even more schools. “But why should I use the model?” you may ask.
“I could easily make a Discord server and invite some people at my school.” The strength of the Student Community Model
is its wealth of existing infrastructure. A great deal of documentation has already been written, including rules,
information for users, a disciplinary system, administration instructions, announcements, and more. The organization of
the project, including channels, roles, permissions, classes, grades, administration, moderation, bots, websites, and
much more,
has already been developed and tested. Branding and marketing templates also already exist. A custom-made Discord bot
tailored to the model is currently under development (see the <i>Bot</i> section below).
<br><br>
<p style="font-weight: 600">An implementation using the Student Community Model has all the resources, experience, and backing of the model,
    enabling a much more featured and useful product with dramatically less labor.</p>

    How to use the Student Community Model
    <br>
</h3>
<br>
Are you a student who's interested in using the model for your school? Fantastic! Just send <a
        href="mailto:contact@kaveergera.com" style="
        text-underline: #277bff;
        color: black;
        ">contact@kaveergera.com</a> a quick email with the name of your school, and we'll help you get started with all
the resources the Student Community Model offers. (We are planning to implement a more fluid system to get started with
the model at your school soon, but while that system is being developed email is the best way to get started.)

The Student Community Bot is a custom-developed bot for this application that handles a lot of work for the project. It
is currently under development. You can track development and contribute to the bot <a

    FAQs:
    <br>
</h3>

<p class="faq">
    There's already a Student Community server set up for my school. How do I join it?
</p>
Unfortunately, we can't put the invite links to the current servers on this website at this time in order to ensure the
privacy of the servers. Email verification is currently being developed; when it is complete, invites to current
implementations will be available on this website. For now, we suggest asking someone at your school who is already a
member of the server to invite you. You can also email <a href="mailto:contact@kaveergera.com" style="
        text-underline: #277bff;
        color: black;
        ">contact@kaveergera.com</a> from your school email address to be given an invite.

<p class="faq">
    Why isn't the model designed to include teachers in the servers?
</p>
Limiting the servers to students was a deliberate decision. Having a teacher present prevents truly open and helpful
conversation. Without a teacher surveilling their conversations, students don't have to worry about the teacher thinking
they weren't paying attention in class and are more likely to get the help they need. You can rest assured that our
clear, robust, and comprehensive rules, disciplinary system, and administration and moderation teams are designed to
eliminate academic dishonesty and any other potential problems.

<p class="faq">
    Why should I use the Student Community Model if the COVID-19 situation is getting better?
</p>
Although the Student Community Model was originally created during the COVID-19 pandemic, it continues to be extremely
useful to students even when their school is using fully in-person instruction. The ability to communicate and
collaborate after school or on weekends with other students is still eminently valuable even when students don't have to
social-distance or wear masks.

<p class="faq">
    I don't have any programming experience. Will I still be able to set up an implementation of the model at my school?
</p>
You don't need any programming experience to use the Student Community Model at your school! Even if you are new to
Discord, the Student Community Model makes making a complex project very simple. All it takes is a little bit of time
and enthusiasm!

<p class="faq">
    My school already has a Discord server that some students use. Is it possible to implement the model in an existing
    server?
</p>
Absolutely! The Student Community Model can bring more features, practicality, organization, and resources to an existing
server. See the <i>How to use the Student Community Model</i> section above for how to get started.

<p class="faq">
    This is super cool. I want to help with the project!

We're thrilled you like it! The best way to help with the project is to start using the model at your school. (See the <i> How to use the Student Community Model</i> section above.) You can also help with the development of the <a
